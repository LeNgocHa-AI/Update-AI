 Mother - a short word but contains many deep meanings.  Mother is the first person we meet when we are born, her eyes are full of love and happiness when she sees her child.  Mother is the first person we hear the voice, the soft lullaby for the baby to sleep.  Mother is the first person we feel the warmth and safety in her arms.

	("Write a long essay about climate change?", """Climate change is a serious global problem that is causing dangerous impacts on the environment and on our lives.  In this article, we will explore the causes, consequences and solutions to mitigate the effects of climate change.

 The main cause of climate change is the increase of greenhouse gases in the air.  Greenhouse gases are greenhouse gases, such as CO2, methane and nitrous oxide, which create a blanket around the Earth and trap heat from the ground.  However, due to human activities such as burning of fossil fuels, logging, high-tech agriculture and industry, the amount of greenhouse gases in the air has increased significantly.

 The consequences of climate change are worrisome.  Increasing global temperature increases sea levels, causing flooding and saltwater intrusion in coastal areas.  High temperatures also cause changes in habitats, affecting biodiversity, and causing the loss of some plant and animal species.  In addition, climate change is also causing an increase in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts and tornadoes.

 To mitigate the effects of climate change, we need to change the way we live and think about the environment.  One of the important solutions is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  This can be achieved by increasing the use of renewable energy such as solar and wind, reducing reliance on fossil energy, and promoting cleaner and more efficient technology.

 In addition, the protection of forests and land also plays an important role in mitigating climate change.  Forests are a source of CO2 and oxygen, so protecting forests and planting trees is an effective way to reduce greenhouse gases in the air.  At the same time, it is necessary to promote land protection measures such as limiting land use and preventing land loss due to urbanization and agricultural expansion.

 In addition, we need to change our consumption habits and lifestyles to reduce waste and greenhouse gas emissions.  We can save energy by using energy- and water-saving appliances, taking public transport, or using eco-friendly transport such as bicycles.  We should also focus on eating and shopping sustainably, choosing organic and recycled products to reduce waste.

 At the same time, we need to increase awareness and education about climate change.  Governments, NGOs and individuals all have a responsibility to participate in education and create educational programs about climate change.  We need to accelerate the research and development of new technologies to mitigate the effects of climate change and create sustainable solutions for the future.

 Finally, we need to cooperate and act together as an international community to deal with climate change.  We need to sign and implement international agreements and commitments like the Paris Agreement on climate change.  Governments, businesses and individuals need to work together, sharing technologies and experiences to achieve their goals of reducing emissions and adapting to climate change.

 In conclusion, climate change is an ongoing problem and requires drastic action from all of us.  We can't wait and hope that someone else will solve this problem.  We need to change the way we live and act, and work together to protect the environment and our future.  Only when we stand together can we deal with climate change and create a sustainable future for future generations.  Let's act together now to protect our planet!"""),

	("substance KMnO4", """KMnO‚ÇÑ is the chemical formula of potassium manganeseate (potassium permanganate).  It is a relatively common purple chemical compound and is used in a variety of applications, including in chemical analysis, oxidation and reduction, and in a number of other chemical reactions.

 Potassium manganeseate can participate in many different chemical reactions, for example:

 1. Oxidation reaction: Potassium manganeseate has the ability to oxidize other substances in an acidic environment, producing manganese dioxide (MnO‚ÇÇ) and manganese ions (Mn2+).  For example:

    2KMnO‚ÇÑ + 3H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ -> K‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ + 2MnSO‚ÇÑ + 3H‚ÇÇO + 5O‚ÇÇ

 2. Reduction reaction: Potassium manganeseate can be reduced to other forms of manganese, such as manganese (Mn2+) or manganese dioxide (MnO‚ÇÇ), under suitable conditions.  For example:

    3MnO‚ÇÑ- + 4H+ + 2e- -> 3MnO‚ÇÇ + 2H‚ÇÇO

 3. Redox reaction: Potassium manganeseate can also be used to oxidize other substances in alkaline media, producing manganate ions (MnO‚ÇÑ2-) or manganese ions (Mn2+).  For example:

    2KMnO‚ÇÑ + 2KOH -> K‚ÇÇMnO‚ÇÑ + 2H‚ÇÇO

 The above reactions are just a few common examples, and potassium manganeseate can participate in many other reactions depending on the conditions and other agents."""),

It is extremely reactive and can react explosively with many other substances, including water and organic compounds.  Because of its reactivity, fluorine is mainly used in industrial processes, such as in the production of uranium hexafluoride as nuclear fuel and in the synthesis of various fluorinated compounds.  It is also used in the manufacture of fluorocarbon refrigerants and in some dental products.
